# Changing Variables

Now you’ll use a variable to quickly change your program. Variables are used to store some kind of data in a program that can be referenced elsewhere (often more than once).

Variables look different in different programming languages. In the code editor, there’s a line that looks like this:
```
  message = 'Change the message!';
```
This line creates a message variable and stores the Change the message! text in it.

Later in the program, message is used to reference that text inside drawName(), meaning that the message text appears on the screen.

# Instructions

1.Change the text stored in the single quotes ('') stored in the message variable from 'Change the message!' to a new message.
